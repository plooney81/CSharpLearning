## About this repository
* Main goals of this repository:
  * To learn the basics of C#

## **General**
* This repository was built using C# couple with [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/)
  * .NET is a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a unified set of class libraries


## Lessons Learned
* C# is a type-safe programming language, which I am not used to. Essentially it means you have to do a little more planning when assigning/declaring/initializing variables.
  > In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors.
