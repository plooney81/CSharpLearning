## About this repository
* Main goals of this repository:
  * To learn the basics of C#

## **General**
* This repository was built using C# couple with [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/)
  * .NET is a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a unified set of class libraries
  
* Different Pieces throughout the repository:
  * basics --> This houses the very first code I wrote while learning C#. Specifically, learned how to output "Hello World" in the console using the WriteLine built in C# method.
  * Variables --> Folder for learning about variables. Found out here that I variables must house data of the same type they were declared.
  * Numbers --> Folder for learning about numbers and how to manipulate them in C#.
  * Calculator --> Expanding on numbers learning, learned how to get user input using the ReadLine built in method.
  * Madlib --> Expanded on both my understanding of user inputs and string manipulation. Learned an alternate to perform string concatenation using the $"{}" syntax.

## Lessons Learned
* C# is a type-safe programming language, which I am not used to. Essentially it means you have to do a little more planning when assigning/declaring/initializing variables.
  > In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors.
